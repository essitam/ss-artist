Fragmented Gathering, Archiving Presence, Outdoor Art Gallery, 2021:
We have carved out an environment where you become creative contributors to the installation. We had pastels, chalk & fabric dye and let you create the work itself.  A communal performance, the idea is that the installation becomes a unified visual archive of presence and gathering in a time when sharing space is so fragmented. We aim to offer an antidote to this unprecedented social scarcity: gesturing generosity, care-free expression, and the lightness and sense of unity we are all craving.
At the end of this 48-hour performance, the installation will reach its final state of being: an artifact reflecting a community of experience that celebrates our human capacity for creativity, imagination and desire for community.
From July 17-18th, at any and all hours of the day, through the open space gallery people came and went as they pleased.
We would like to thank the OCAD University Student Union for their financial support and in helping us realize this project. Fragmented Gathering, Archiving Presence was conceived of, created and exists on the ancestral and traditional territories of the Mississaugas of the New Credit, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy of Six Nations, the Anishinaabe and the Huron-Wendat nations, who are the original, current and future caretakers of the land on which we live and create. We give thanks to those nations who have lived on and protected this territory prior to and against colonization, and we also acknowledge and give thanks to those nations who have lived here since time immemorial on whose territory we now live and create.
