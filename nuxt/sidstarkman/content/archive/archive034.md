Tea Time, 2018 : This performance reflects the desire to ask questions about the anxiety of representation. I ask myself: how do I approach representation of a place that conflicts with the dominant narrative that is the Israeli Palestinian conflict. The people who I had the fortune of crossing paths with showed me a side of Palestine and Israel that completely opposed the religious, historical and moral tensions they deal with on a daily basis. The gestures of love that I was shown by complete strangers touched my core. NEW PARAGRAPH: Sharing this experience of generosity and respite with the audience. I invited strangers to help me make nana tea (mint tea); together creating a space where people could relax, sit down and take time. The political nature of food is experienced in a gallery space where too often these questions of  relationality are not considered. Honouring the spirits of the individuals who allowed me to understand my own narrative, to listen, learn and come together rather than divide.
